      About US Hi! Welcome to our web page. I am excited to see you here exploring who are we and what we do. Well, I am a Certified Lifeforming Coach, Trainer,
      and Keynote/Transformational Speaker. I am the president of the Institute of Leadership Education and Development known by its acronym ILEAD; our motto:
      “Empowering Leaders for Every Situation." ILEAD was created after being frustrated with “leaders” who did not know how to deal with stressful situations
      when they presented. ILEAD is the instrument you can use to challenge yourself and to take you to the next level of greatness and success. Let me partner
      with you. If you ready, and only you know if you are or not, contact me NOW! Moreover, as a John Maxwell Certified Coach, Teacher, Trainer, and Speaker, I
      can offer you workshops, seminars, keynote speaking, and coaching, aiding your personal and professional growth through study and practical application of
      John’s proven leadership methods. Working together, I will move you and/or your team or organization in the desired direction to reach your goals. Contact
      Me. I am looking forward to assisting you on your journey to becoming a successful leader. Together we can unlock the leader in you for every situation.
